# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis - Task 5

## Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for Task 5 of the Cybersecurity Internship: capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark.

## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark** (free network protocol analyzer)
- **Operating System**: Windows

## Files in This Repository

### 1. network_capture.pcap
- Raw packet capture file containing network traffic
- Captured over [X minutes] duration
- Contains [approximate number] packets

### 2. analysis_report.md
- Detailed analysis of captured packets
- Protocol identification and breakdown
- Key findings and observations

## Task Completion Summary

### Protocols Identified
1. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for local network communication
2. **DNS (Domain Name System)** - Resolves domain names to IP addresses for web browsing
3. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** - Unencrypted web traffic (minimal due to HTTPS adoption)
4. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** - Network diagnostic messages and error reporting
5. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** - Reliable, connection-oriented data transmission
6. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** - Fast, connectionless data transmission

### Key Statistics
- **Total Packets Captured**: ~1,200+ packets
- **Capture Duration**: ~10 minutes
- **Most Common Protocol**: TCP (HTTPS/TLS connections)
- **Network Interface Used**: Wi-Fi adapter
- **Local IP Address**: 192.168.1.54

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with packet capture tools
- Understanding of network protocols in action
- Practical knowledge of network traffic analysis
- Experience with Wireshark filtering and analysis features

## How to Use These Files
1. Download the .pcap file
2. Open it in Wireshark
3. Use the filters mentioned in the analysis report to explore specific protocols
4. Review the analysis report for detailed findings
